 GitHub Pages
Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.2.0 and higher.

Step 1: Add homepage to package.json
The step below is important!

If you skip it, your app will not deploy correctly.

Open your package.json and add a homepage field for your project:

  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",
or for a GitHub user page:

  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io",
or for a custom domain page:

  "homepage": "https://mywebsite.com",
Create React App uses the homepage field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.

Step 2: Install gh-pages and add deploy to scripts in package.json
Now, whenever you run npm run build, you will see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.

To publish it at https://myusername.github.io/my-app, run:

npm install --save gh-pages
Alternatively you may use yarn:

yarn add gh-pages
Add the following scripts in your package.json:

  "scripts": {
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
The predeploy script will run automatically before deploy is run.

If you are deploying to a GitHub user page instead of a project page you'll need to make one additional modification:

Tweak your package.json scripts to push deployments to master:
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
-   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -b master -d build",
Step 3: Deploy the site by running npm run deploy
Then run:

npm run deploy
Step 4: For a project page, ensure your projectâ€™s settings use gh-pages
Finally, make sure GitHub Pages option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the gh-pages branch:

gh-pages branch setting
Step 5: Optionally, configure the domain
You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a CNAME file to the public/ folder.

Your CNAME file should look like this:
